# Python Security Tool: Password Strength Evaluator

Status: Functional Prototype! 

This tool analyzes the security level of passwords based on industry-standard criteria. It provides real-time feedback and actionable hints to help users create stronger, more secure credentials.
## Current Focus

    Security Logic: Implementing a scoring system based on complexity rules (length, casing, digits, and special characters).

    Pattern Recognition: Detecting weak habits, such as consecutive identical characters, to encourage better security practices.

    User Feedback: Generating dynamic hint lists that guide the user toward a "Strong" password level.

    Input Handling: Building a continuous command-line interface (CLI) with clean exit conditions.

## Tech Stack

    Python 3 (Logic & String Analysis)

    Functional Programming: Modular design with focused functions for evaluation and pattern detection.

## Note

This project is part of my journey to understand the intersection of software development and basic cybersecurity principles. I am currently exploring ways to expand this by checking passwords against known "leaked password" lists or adding a graphical interface.

Working on this tool sharpened my focus on defensive programming and showed me how small logic checks can significantly improve user security.
