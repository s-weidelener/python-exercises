# 🐍 Python Learning Journey: Exercises & Projects

Welcome to my Python practice repository! This collection documents my progress as I prepare for my vocational training as a Software Developer. Each folder contains a standalone script focusing on different core concepts of programming.

## 📂 Project Overview

| Folder | Project | Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01_expiry_checker** | Expiry Date Tracker | SQLite Databases & Datetime logic |
| **02_password_evaluation** | Password Evaluator | String analysis & Security basics |
| **03_number_guessing** | Guessing Game | Game Loops & User Input validation |
| **04_grade_list** | Grade Calculator | Math operations & Exception handling |

## 🛠️ Getting Started
To run any of these scripts, ensure you have Python 3 installed. Navigate into the specific folder and run the `.py` file:
`python name_of_script.py`

## 🎯 Goal
Developing these tools allows me to apply theoretical concepts to hands-on projects. I am continuously expanding this repository to document my growth and explore new ways to build reliable, logic-driven applications.
