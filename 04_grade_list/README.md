# Python Tool: Grade Calculator & Evaluator

Status: Functional Prototype 

A practical utility to calculate the average of academic grades and provide a qualitative evaluation (e.g., "Gut", "Sehr gut"). This project focuses on mathematical logic, list management, and robust error handling.
## Current Focus

    Mathematical Logic: Implementing a reliable average calculation while handling edge cases (e.g., preventing division by zero).

    Data Validation: Using try-except blocks to catch ValueError exceptions, ensuring the program only processes valid integers.

    Conditional Mapping: Translating numerical results into human-readable evaluations using a structured if-elif-else logic.

    Dynamic Lists: Collecting an undefined number of user inputs in a list before performing final operations.

## Tech Stack

    Python 3 (Logic & Calculation)

    Exception Handling: Robust input filtering with try-except.

## Note

One of the key learnings here was the importance of data sanitization. I had to ensure that not only numbers are entered, but specifically numbers between 1 and 6. It’s a small scale example of how professional software must handle "bad" user input.

This utility focuses on clean data processing. It helped me understand the importance of validating input before performing mathematical operations.
