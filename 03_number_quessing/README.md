# Python Game: Number Guessing Challenge

Status: Functional Prototype!

A classic logic-based game where the player has to guess a randomly generated number. This project focuses on handling user input, managing game states, and implementing basic error validation.
## Current Focus

    Control Flow: Using while loops and if/elif/else statements to manage the game logic and "try" limits.

    Input Validation: Ensuring the program doesn't crash by checking if the user input is a valid number via .isdigit().

    Randomization: Implementing the random module to create a unique experience in every round.

    Game State Management: Resetting variables (like tries and the target number) to allow the player to start a new round without restarting the script.

## Tech Stack

    Python 3 (Core Logic)

    Random Module (Integer Generation)

## Note

This project was a great exercise in managing "edge cases" – for example, what happens when a player enters a letter instead of a number? It helped me understand how to make a program more robust and user-friendly.

Building this game was a fun way to master the 'Game Loop' concept and refine how a program handles unpredictable user behavior.
