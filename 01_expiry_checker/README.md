🐍 Python Database Project: Expiry Date Tracker

Status: Functional Prototype 🚧 This project focuses on backend logic and database management. It is designed to track product expiration dates using a local database, helping to automate inventory checks and reduce waste.
🎯 Current Focus

    Database Management: Implementing CRUD operations and table structures using SQLite3.

    Date Logic: Handling time-based calculations with Python's datetime module (e.g., calculating days until expiry).

    Data Persistence: Learning how to store, commit, and fetch data from a local .db file.

    Automated Checks: Developing logic to categorize products (expired vs. expiring soon) based on real-time data.

🛠️ Tech Stack

    Python 3 (Core Logic)

    SQLite3 (Database Engine)

    Datetime Module (Time Calculations)

📝 Note

This script is a core component of my backend learning path. I am currently refining the error handling (e.g., for missing dates) and planning to expand the "check" function to include automated email notifications or a graphical user interface (GUI).

This project helps me to better understand the logic behind databases and to solve practical problems with code.
